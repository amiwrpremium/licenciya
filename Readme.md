# Intro
This is a possibly shitty, easy to crack, dumbass, software licensing library.
<br>
Publishing it here and also on pypi was a showoff ngl. =DDD
<br>
<br>
I'm still working on it. For me, it gets shit done. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
<br>
<br>
I know if it's licensing tool it shouldn't be open source and all.
But it's for small purposes for beginners like me.

# Installation
You can install it using pip:
<br>
`pip install licensiya`
<br>
<br>
<br>
Or you can build it from source:
<br>
That's on you. I don't know how you can do that but you can. 
I've seen other people put this on their repository, I just always wanted to say that.<br>
Why would you want to do that anyway when you can simply install by pip? 
You wanna show you are superior? 
Yeaah, that sound about right


# How it works
First you, the app king, should make a post requests to my API (lol, I have API now) and
add product license for a user there.
<br>
<br>
Then in the app, it automatically gets something unique (for now it's `uuid.getnode()` to be more exact)
and send post request to my API and submit it there in a database if the license is previously added by you.
(and yes Jafar. The API there is made with python and yes, I'm sure python is good enough and can handle concurrent)
<br>
<br>
Next it uses built-in validate function to check if license is valid.
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately for now if you want to use this stupid ass tool (which btw you shouldn't) 
you have to contact me and get an api_key for submitting product license as an app developer.
<br>
<br>
Maybe I'll make a website to automate that shit and give everyone access to the API.

# Example:
```
from Licenser import LicenseApp

li = LicenseApp()
li.make_config_file('Data.ini')
li.set_server_submit_url('https://amiwr-license.herokuapp.com/submit-license')
li.set_server_validate_url('https://amiwr-license.herokuapp.com/validate-license')

li.submit_license()  # If no license provided in config file, it prompts and input to get it from user

if li.validate_license():
    print('Valid License')
else:
    print('Invalid License')
```
